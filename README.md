# GitStatusChecker
Very simple app that calls "git status" for a saved list of folders to help you check multiple folders quickly without going to each one.

Written in Delphi 10.2 Tokyo (freshly compiled in Delphi 11).  Very simple VCL app, uses the DosCommand component from the GetIt! library.

Also uses the LayoutSaver component from [ccLib](https://github.com/corneliusdavid/ccLib).
